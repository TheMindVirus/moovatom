[UNITY_MATRIX_I_V][Default Facing Towards Unity +Z]
Recordings are subject to subjective rotation direction bias
[0].x = Camera Y Rotation (Cosine) (-Sine of +X Facing)
[0].y = Camera Z Rotation (-Sine)
[0].z = Camera Y Rotation (-Sine)
[0].w = Camera X Position
[1].x = Camera Z Rotation (Sine)
[1].y = Camera X Rotation (Cosine)
[1].z = Camera X Rotation (-Sine)
[1].w = Camera Y Position
[2].x = Camera Y Rotation (-Sine)
[2].y = Camera X Rotation (Sine)
[2].z = Camera Y Rotation (-Cosine)
[2].w = Camera Z Position
[3].x = 0
[3].y = 0
[3].z = 0
[3].w = 1
This encoding is at best misleading.
Forward is +Z and Right is +X where +Y is Up.
Other Forward is +X and Left is +Y where +Z is Up.
However, it is in effect as of Unity 2019.4.40f1.
This is the engine version that Tabletop Simulator
chose to migrate to. It has not been documented.
